# Mt-Wilson-Workshops
This repository has been created to serve as a landing page for Astronomy Workshops being planned at Mt Wilson.  The primary purpose if this site to allow for all particpants to reach various locations on the internet to access files and other resouces needed for the workshops including with schedules and attendee information. 

Some of these locations may not be accessible as they might be passwords protected and you might have to request the owner of these locations for access.

This repository is available for public access for those who have the links, so I will take care not to include phone numbers and other personal information here.
