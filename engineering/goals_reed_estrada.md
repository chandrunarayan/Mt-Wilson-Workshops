Below is a list of software requirements for live data collection with students at the telescope.  Obviously we can not use many of the automated features offered by NINA and other software suits.  Much of this is experience based knowledge of past Mt Wilson observations.  
 
List of Software we have available
 
NINA
Sharp Cap
Fire capture 
ZWO camera software (ricks program). 
 
1. Rapid ability to format the target information for the collection attempt to include the name of the target and the storage location that the target data will be stored. Much of this can be preprogrammed however experience has shown that plans often go rapidly wrong based on many factors so a quick method to flex to new targets needs to be supported by the software.
 
2. A Rapid method of switching from live view to ROI and back.  Then an easy ROI process once the target is centered in focus and ready for collection.  We have experienced some significant gain and exposure changes when we have constrained the ROI on the ZWO camera so being able to rapidly adjust gain and exposure after ROI selection is a must. 
 
3. Rapid method of adjusting exposure times and gains hopefully slider based.  We often choose targets that are vary in separation and brightness and Delta between the primary and secondary and allot of adjustment is done to get the pair to show in the camera based on seeing, telescope focal length and camera sensitivity. 
 
4. A histogram function live and running  in conjunction with the above controls to adjust gain and exposure to prevent saturation. 
 
5.   easy programming and execution of collection functions to include FITS file formatting exposure times, number of exposers,  data pathways target names ect ect.
It should be inspectable before we hit the execute button to assure settings are correct.  I know allot of the data formatting can be preserved in the FITS file header however it’s far easier to know before we execute that the camera is set up correctly and far better for Tom’s planned data distribution plan to know where the data is headed and in what format before we hit collect. 
 
6. We talked about the requirement to platesove to extract the camera angle for data reduction. We also have expectations based on Dave Rowe’s wishes to do many plate solves  through out the collection period.  We have in past used Dave’s speckle toolbox to plate solve at the telescope on the camera control computer.  I believe this is probably not a best proactive as it involves another program running in the background using memory resources.  We have identified problems with the ZWO camera stalling as a result of computer memory overload.  I have observed this on our setup lately. It would be best if the collection program had a plate solve function but it needs to be easy to run.  This also drives a requirement for possible targets for plate solving like clusters with their coordinates ready.  Past experience with the 50 inch telescope shows poor plate solving performance when trying to solve on target stars because of the very small field of view offered by this big telescope. Even with the large full frame cameras it will be difficult to get the minimum stars in view using target pairs. 
 
7. The software package needs to be simple enough to run to allow Leon or Rick or Tom and Myself to explain to a student to allow them to participate.  We should have a training session in the afternoon with the students so they can understand the process.  It’s literally why we are having the students attend and be on the mountain! 
 
8. Obviously this all has to come together so as not to waste valuable telescope time trying to puzzle this out on the mountain.
