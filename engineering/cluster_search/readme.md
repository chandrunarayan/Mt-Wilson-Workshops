# Tom's Cluster Search Python Program

"I thought you might like the program I wrote in python for cluster searching. It is attached as a zipped file and the zip contains two files, “clusterSearch.py” and “clusters.sdb” which is the database behind the program. I did not make the file executable so you can run it using “python3 clusterSearch.py”, assuming you have python3 installed on a computer.

If you want to share it with others, then please do. It is a bit crude but should get the job done."
